"I Wish I May"

Shove me under you again
I can't wait for this to end
Sober, empty in the head
I know I can never win
Why should I have to wait
I'll just look the other way

[Chorus:]
We left this land of shiny lights
I wish I may, I wish I might
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were, you're not my friend

I can see you suffocate
I can find no other way
Try to make you saturate
I can be your enemy
Why should I have to wait
I'll just look the other way

[Chorus]

Woah no

[Chorus]

You said you'd love
To see the end
The long hard road
That I have been
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were, you're not my friend
Blind eyes shine bright
